**Disclaimer**
The author is not responsible for any misuse of the code. Do not use this code for any illegal activities.

**Description**
This code installs and sets up various tools for ethical hacking and pentesting. The tools include Metasploit, sqlmap, Nmap, Wireshark, the Social Engineer Toolkit, and Wifite2. The code also installs dependencies and sets up proxychains and tor for anonymous browsing.

**Functionality**
The code can be run with the optional argument --delete to delete all installed tools and dependencies. Otherwise, the code will update the system and install the necessary dependencies, including Git if it is not already installed. The code will then clone the repositories for the aforementioned tools and set up proxychains and tor.

#The reason behind this script

There will be situations for you as a pentester where you won't have access to your tools and software, or maybe all you have access to is an ordinary Debian Based Operating system. That's where this piece of software comes in handy.
Always keep it on your USB drive and you will be able to get that machine up and ready for hacking in no time.

#Note

This code needs lots of edits to be more user-friendly and I'm currently working on the next version that will offer the user to choose what he needs since I choose the packages and the tools based on what I usually use when pentesting
